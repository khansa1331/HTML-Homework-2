    <h3>what is meant by an HTML "comment"</h3>
    <!-- Used the less than and greater than tags to emphasise the example of what are comment tags used for. -->
    <p>The HTML Comment Tag is used to add a comment in an HTML document. An HTML comment is first started by the "&lt;!--" and the comment closes with "--&gt;." The comment tag is used to insert comments within the source code. It helps describe what the programmer is doing and it is used to describe ones code that is already written or published. This is very helpful to decribe long pages of code in an html document in order for a new person to understand what your are working on. This helps make the code more readable and easier to understand. This is epecially important when someone else has to work on the code you have written. An example is if you have to write HTML code for your company and other people are there to work on it with you. In this case comments are important to expalin your code to the other memebers of your company's group in order for them to add on to where you left off.</p>
